== Translate 2014.11 ==
Released at 2014-11-29.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Translate WebAPI documentation is now localized. Only works in MediaWiki 1.24
and newer.
* Fixed a bug which prevented bootstrapping of shared TTMServer database with
the ElasticSearch backend.
* If you are using the '''Solr backend '''for the translation memory or the
translation search, please let us know. If there are no users for the Solr
backend, we will deprecate and later remove it in favor of the better
maintained ElasticSearch backend.
