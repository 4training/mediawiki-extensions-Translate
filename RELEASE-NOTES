== Translate 2013.01 ==
Released at 2013-01-31.

=== Highlights ===
Work continues with the new Translate UX. Many new features have been added,
many issues fixed and WebAPIs have been extented to support the new features.
It is not yet ready for production use, but can be tested by appending query
param tux=1 to the url on Special:Translate (tux=0 to get back).

New search page Special:SearchTranslations was created. It depends on working
TTMServer configuration with Solr backend. More info:

=== Developer and compatiblity changes ===
All translation helpers were refactored into TranslationAids and
TranslationWebService classes. The old interfaces will be kept around
for a while, until they are refactored to use these new classes.

Translatons aids are now also available in the WebApi. More information:
