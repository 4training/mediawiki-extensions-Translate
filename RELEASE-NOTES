== Translate 2014.10 ==
Released at 2014-10-31.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* New feature: Remove any page from translation with two clicks from Special:PageTranslation. Previously, translate tags had to be removed manually first.
* Special:PageTranslation also has prettier warning and error notifications.
* The user group translate-proofr is no longer created by default. If you were using it, you can add it back with following code in your LocalSettings.php:
 $wgGroupPermissions['translate-proofr']['translate-messagereview'] = true;
 $wgAddGroups['translate-proofr'] = array( 'translate-proofr' );
* Removed $wgTranslatePageMigration (enabled by default), $wgTranslateUseTux (no longer in use) and translate-proofr group (needs sysadmin action if in use).
* Bug 48672: When marking page for translation, show a note before submit if there are no differences.
* Added support for page status indicators. This alters very slightly the way help icons are displayed on some special pages.
