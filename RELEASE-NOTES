== Translate 2012.12 ==
Released at 2012-12-20.

Lots of development is ongoing on the translation user interface
redesign project conducted by the WMF Language Engineering Team.
New message list and translation editor are in alpha stage, but
interested users can activate them by using url parameter tux=1
while on Special:Translate. Also, tux=0 gets back the old
interface.

$wgTranslateAC and $wgTranslateEC were removed. If you were still
using these, switch over to the TranslatePostInitGroups hook or
$wgTranslateCC.

Other noteworthy changes:
* MessageGroups::getParentGroups was renamed to getSharedGroups.
* New MessageGroups::getParentGroups was added which returns
  all the paths from top-level groups to reach to given group.
* Bundled Solarium library was removed. Install it manually or
  use the MediaWiki Solarium extensions.
* ApiQueryMessageGroups module has lots of new functionality.
* There is new ApiQueryLanguageStats module.
* (Bug 39761) Special:TranslationStats counts for edits includes
   also reviews
* GettextFFS: Handle empty but existing msgctxt properly
* WikiMessageGroup: check that message definition message exists
* New hook: TranslateSupportedLanguages
* Lots of code maintenance and translation updates.
