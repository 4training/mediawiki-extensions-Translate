== Translate 2016.01 ==
Released at 2016-01-29.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Old custom tokens were deprecated in favor of using regular "csrf" (previously known as "edit") token. If you are using Translate WebAPIs you might need to migrate.
* Special:Translations no longer shows PHP notices for pages with invalid language codes
* Special:Translate now longer shows deprecation warnings about access keys in the JavaScript console.
* Translate is now syntactically compatible with PHP7.
* Message group selector on Special:SearchTranslations no longer has glitchy behavior after selecting a group.
* MessageIndex code was optimized. It now ignored messages not in $wgTranslateMessageNamespaces. By default this should be fine, but if you have translations in custom namespaces, check that they are included.
* Pages with <languages /> now load faster with cold caches.
* MachineTranslationAid no longer throws uncaught exceptions with default configuration that broke other translation aids.
