== Translate 2017.07 ==
Released at 2017-07-26.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Translate extension no longer bundles spyc library. If you need support for
parsing and generating YAML files, and you don't have phpyaml extensions
installed (HHVM provides it in PHP compatibility mode), then you can install
spyc using composer update. (T75945)
* Niklas Laxström fixed a broken error propagation in translator sandbox user
creation in case of an invalid password. (T164912)
* User TerraCodes removed redundant dialog title from the message group
selector. (T165241)
* Niklas Laxström added informative warning message that warns about
non-existent message groups.
* Niklas Laxström fixed a bug that could cause translation completion
statistics to not update in some situations (e.g. translatable pages within an
aggregate message group).
