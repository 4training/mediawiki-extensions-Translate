== Translate 2013.05-rc ==
Released at 2013-05-29.

The new Translate UX is becoming stable. The last month saw mostly polishing and bug fixes in TUX and also in some of the internals of the extension.

Terminology was made more consistent:
* Message documentation is now consistently called "documentation" rather than "description".
* "Review" is now used consistently instead of "proofread" or "approve".

Other notable bug fixes:
* Warnings are loaded for fuzzy messages before user starts typing, because being fuzzy is an issue in itself.
* Statsbar is updated when changing group.
* Tab links are updated when updating page location dynamically.
* Custom search box clear icon (x) was removed. The software now relies on its automatic addition, which is available in some browsers.
* The tooltips were removed from the group selector rows. It was too complicated, but added little information.
* Message documentation can be added when translation is restricted.
* Icons for review actions for right-to-left languages were added.
* Direction and code for the language name in the target langugage selector is now properly defined.
