== Translate 2013.03 ==
Released at 2013-03-29.

=== Highlights ===
==== Translation UX ====
The new Translation UX is getting out of the beta status and becoming
release-ready.

The variable $wgTranslateUseTux can be used to control which interface
will the users see by default. The default value is true. Set it to false
to make the old green-style translations editor show by default. The user
can choose the editor version by adding tux=0 or tux=1 to the URL.

The plan is to remove the old editor in the future.

==== Other notes ====

Translate features, but no new features were introduced. See below for details.
