== Translate 2013.10 ==
Released at 2013-10-28.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Introducing of the TranslationStash feature.
  It's the place where sandboxed users can store their translations before they are given full translator rights.
** Added special page for TranslationStash.
** Show the translations of the user for review in Special:TranslateSandbox.
* The Autonym font is now used in the language list and the tagcloud in Special:SupportedLanguages.
* Bug 55607: Use group source language instead of hardcoded 'en' language.
  For most cases (e.g., at translatewiki.net) the source language of translations is English, this is not always the case. Source language is set to group's source language now.
