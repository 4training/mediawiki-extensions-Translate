We implement some custom changes on the Translate extension for 4training.net:

- different design of the "available languages" box with link to more information on that language
- some information is only shown to logged-in users (languages with less than 80% progress,
  "translate this page to" button, translation progress of a page)
- style customizations: disabled some stuff to override it in our custom skin 

  (TODO find a better solution to not have these changes in one repository?)
